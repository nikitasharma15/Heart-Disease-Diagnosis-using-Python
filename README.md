# Heart-Disease-Diagnosis
Project Objective : Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better future preparation.

Details of the Dataset :
These all the parameters which are used to identify the Heart Disease Diagonis - 

* age
* sex
* chest pain type (4 values)
* resting blood pressure
* serum cholestoral in mg/dl
* fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
* resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
* maximum heart rate achieved
* exercise induced angina
* oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
* thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

Tools Used : Python Programming Language and its Libararies such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn etc. , Jupyter Notebook
Useful Insights :
1) Chest pain type (0), i.e - Typical Angina is more common  among the people.
2) Higher number of Heart Disease patients without Diabetes.
3) Males have the more Heart Disease than Females.
4) Most People have "Non-Anginal Chest Pain" type(2) - Chest Pain without Heart Diesease.
